	//you can use the so called comma initializer to set all the coefficients to some values
	my_vector << 10, 20;
	cout << my_vector << endl;


	//the matrices can be created in the same way.
	//For example, This is an initialization of a 2 by 2 matrix
	//with the values 1, 2, 3, and 4
	MatrixXd my_matrix(2,2);
	my_matrix << 1, 2,
			3, 4;
	cout << my_matrix << endl;


	//you can use the same comma initializer or you can set each matrix value explicitly
	// For example that's how we can change the matrix elements in the second row
	my_matrix(1,0) = 11;    //second row, first column
	my_matrix(1,1) = 12;    //second row, second column
	cout << my_matrix << endl;


	//Also, you can compute the transpose of a matrix with the following command
	MatrixXd my_matrix_t = my_matrix.transpose();
	cout << my_matrix_t << endl;


	//And here is how you can get the matrix inverse
	MatrixXd my_matrix_i = my_matrix.inverse();
	cout << my_matrix_i << endl;


	//For multiplying the matrix m with the vector b you can write this in one line as let’s say matrix c equals m times v.
	//
	MatrixXd another_matrix;
	another_matrix = my_matrix*my_vector;
	cout << another_matrix << endl;
